    This is slightly awkward.. I don't have a good idea for doing this yet
    Receiving an SMS from an email, a la to: 9082165058@txt.att.net
    Results in an SMS with da being ATT's SMS gateway and the actual
    sender's identity is in text along with the content. This creates
    a pretty legitimate security nightmare. For now (for demo purposes)
    I'm just going to return True; however, this MUST be fixed.

    For example:
    FRM:Earle West \nSUBJ:POLLING YOU\nMSG:7328584026@txt.att.net\r\ncurl --request POST 'http://transactionalweb.com/mconnect.php'

    Write the config (as a dict) to the config file
    A convenient thing about this is that we only ADD or MODIFY
    to the config file. This means I don't have to worry about
    the length of the file. I can overwire mercilessly since
    the write will always be at least as long as the read.

    Which brings up a question.... Do we add ability to REMOVE
    eventually? If so, we'll need a /COMMAND/ parser instead of
    just this /CONFIG/ parser.
